`@idio/core` is a koa2-based web server with some pre-installed middleware which facilitates quick creation of a web server with the essential functionality, such as static files serving, compression, body parsing, _etc_. Other components such as `@idio/database`, `@idio/route` and `@idio/jsx` allow to build more complex websites.

yarn add -E @idio/core

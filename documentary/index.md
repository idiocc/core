`@idio/core` is a _Koa2_-based web server with some pre-installed middleware which facilitates quick creation of a web server with the essential functionality, such as serving static files, compression, body parsing, _etc_. It also provides full JSDoc documentation of all options for completion in IDEs. Other components such as `@idio/database`, `@idio/route` and `@idio/jsx` allow to build more complex websites (to come).

```sh
yarn add -E @idio/core
```
